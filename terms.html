        <br />
        PreCallPrep is an application that turns Google Form submissions into

        the data processed by the Service. You understand and acknowledge that
        You are solely responsible for obtaining the Google account and all
        equipment necessary to use the Service, for appropriately configuring

        rights in connection with use of the Service. Your continued use of
        the Service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to
        such changes. You can review the most current version of the Terms of

        <br>
        PreCallPrep may report to law enforcement authorities any actions that may be illegal, and any reports it

        law enforcement agencies in any investigation of alleged illegal activity associated with the Service or on the
        Internet. <br>
        <br>
        Unauthorized use of any trademarked, copyrighted or patented materials contained in the Service may violate
        certain laws and regulations. <br>
        <br>
        You agree to indemnify and hold PreCallPrep and its officers, directors, employees, affiliates, agents,
        licensors, and business partners harmless from and against any and all costs, damages, liabilities, and expenses
        (including attorneys’ fees and costs of defense) PreCallPrep or any other indemnified party suffers in relation
        to, arising from, or for the purpose of avoiding, any claim or demand from a third party that your use of this
        Service or the use of Service by any person using your account (including without limitation, Your Content (as
        defined below)) violates any applicable law or regulation, or the copyrights, trademark rights or other rights
        of any third party. <br>
        <br> <br>
        <strong>Suspension</strong> <br> <br>

        PreCallPrep reserves the right to suspend or terminate Customer’s access to the Service with or without notice
        if PreCallPrep reasonably determines that: (a) there is a threat or attack on the Service (including a denial of
        service attack) or other event that may create a risk to the Service, PreCallPrep, Customer, or any user of the
        Service; (b) Customer’s or its users’ use of the Service or Customer Content disrupts or poses a security risk
        to the Service or any user of the Service, may harm PreCallPrep’ systems, or may subject PreCallPrep or any
        third party to liability; (c) Customer or any User is using the Service for fraudulent or illegal activities;
        (d) subject to applicable law, Customer has ceased to continue Customer’s business in the ordinary course, made
        an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of its assets, or become the subject of any
        bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or similar proceeding; (e) Customer or any User is using
        the Service or other PreCallPrep property in breach of this Agreement; (f) Customer is in default of its payment
        obligations; or (g) The amount of technical support required to be provided to the User is excessive as
        determined in the sole discretion of PreCallPrep.

        <br> <br> <br> <strong>Service fees</strong> <br>
        <br>
        Customer agrees to pay the service fee (if applicable). Such fees will be paid based on the term chosen (e.g
        3-months, 12-months or 24-months). PreCallPrep does not automatically renew your service. Instead, you will
        receive a reminder as you approach the end date, giving you the choice to renew. <br>
        <br>
        PreCallPrep may offer the service in USD and may also offer the Service in additional currencies. <br>
        <br>
        PreCallPrep may amend the service fee from time to time, and will provide a minimum of 30 days' notice when
        amending the USD fees. Service fees in other currencies will be reasonably adjusted, without notice, based on
        direct changes in exchange rates. Customer may choose to purchase or renew in any of the offered currencies.
        Customer's bank may charge a currency conversion fee outside of PreCallPrep control. <br>
        <br>
        In case of non-payment for any reason (including, if applicable, PreCallPrep’ inability to charge your credit
        card or other payment method for any reason) or any violation of these Terms, PreCallPrep shall be entitled,
        without liability, to immediately suspend Customer’s and Users’ access to the Service. If you submit payment via
        our website, you hereby expressly agree that PreCallPrep is permitted to charge you for the applicable fees, any
        applicable tax and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service. <br>
        <br>
        Customer agrees that Customer’s paid use of the Service is neither contingent on the delivery of any future
        functionality or features nor dependent on any oral or written public or private comments made by PreCallPrep
        regarding future functionality or features. <br>
        <br>
        Customer must not change the administrator of the plug-in to avoid usage limits or avoid paying fees. <br>
        <br>
        All service fees are non refundable. The Free plan is available for users to test and use the add-on. <br>
        <br> <br>
        <strong>Intellectual Property </strong><br>
        <br>

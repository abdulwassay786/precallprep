          <strong>1. Why is my information needed?</strong> <br /><br />
          The Service is web based and is therefore required to store a small
          amount of information about you, your usage, and metadata associated
          with your google calendar. <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong
            >2. What information does PreCallPrep gather/track and how is it
            used?</strong
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          PERSONAL INFORMATION: The only personal information we store is the
          add-on administrator's email address. <br />

          BUSINESS INFORMATION: The application stores file metadata (e.g your
          Google email and calendar) to be able to process the information
          received from workflow participants.

          <br />
          <br />

          SECURITY INFORMATION: PreCallPrep may collect certain standard
          information about your computer for security and identification
          purposes. This information may include: IP addresses, domain names,
          access times, cookies and other unique identifying information. This
          information is used for the operation of the service, to identify and
          protect our customers and to control unauthorized use or abuse of our
          services. ​ <br />
          <br />

          We will not view any of your information except as necessary to
          appropriately support the service, for the purpose of anticipating,
          diagnosing, supporting or resolving any problems that might limit or
          disrupt the quality of our customers’ service experience or as
          required by law. ​<br />
          <br />

          We will retain your information for as long as your account is active,
          as needed to provide you services, to comply with our legal
          obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We do not
          share your personal information to third parties except as described
          in this Privacy Policy.
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>3. With whom does PreCallPrep share the information?</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          Ensuring your privacy is important to us. We do not sell, trade or
          rent your personal information to third parties. PreCallPrep products
          and services by necessity require us to provide some of your
          information to third parties. Examples include processing credit card
          payments (if applicable) and sending email (if you choose to have
          emails sent from our domain). They may have access to personal
          information needed to perform their functions and may not use it for
          any other purpose. PreCallPrep does not control the practices of our
          affiliates. If you have questions about how affiliates use the
          information gathered when you link to them, please read their privacy
          policies. <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong
            >4. How does PreCallPrep protect my information from loss, misuse or
            alteration?</strong
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          PreCallPrep has implemented commercially reasonable precautions
          designed to protect the web sites and applications it hosts and the
          information it collects from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access,
          disclosure, alteration, and destruction. For example, we store as
          little information as possible, we cryptographically hash personal
          information where possible, and we logically separate all user's data.
          <br /><br /><br />
          <strong>5. Does PreCallPrep comply with Google's policies?</strong>
          <br />
          <br />
          PreCallPrep has been through several reviews by Google and is subject
          to ongoing reviews each time a change is made to the application or a
          change is made to the authorizations used. The application has been
          through Google's OAuth Client Verification review and Add-on review.
          In addition, we maintain strict compliance with Google API Services:
          User Data Policy and Google APIs Terms of Service. <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong
            >6. Does PreCallPrep comply with other data privacy
            legislation?</strong
          >
          <br />
          <br />
          PreCallPrep has reviewed and is in compliance with General Data
          Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA),
          Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Children’s
          Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>7. How long does PreCallPrep retain data?</strong> <br />
          <br />
          PreCallPrep retains data while your account is active or until you ask
          us to delete the data. <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>8. Can I stop the add-on accessing my data?</strong> <br />
          <br />
          By toggling the add-on OFF on each of your forms, the add-on will no
          longer run when new form submissions are made. In addition, you can
          remove the add-on's authorization to your account at any time via
          Google's third party app permissions page. By removing the
          authorization the add-on will no longer be able to access your files
          and therefore prevent any of your users from using the add-on
          (including your requestors and recipients). <br />
          <br /><br />
          <strong>9. Can I request that my data is deleted?</strong> <br />
          <br />
          In accordance with GDPR, CCPA and other global legislation you have a
          'right to be forgotten'. If you wish to cancel your account and have
          all your data removed, follow these steps in the order provided:
          Remove the add-on's authorization to your account via Google's third
          party app permissions page; and contact dan@precallprep.com: i)
          providing the email address of the user(s) that configured the add-on;
          ii) confirming you have already followed the above steps; and iii)
          confirming that you no longer intend on using the add-on and want all
          data stored outside of your G Suite files deleted. <br />
